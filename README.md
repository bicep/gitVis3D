# GitVis3D for Bitcoin (M. Arch I application project)

**NOTE: GitVis3D is the brainchild of GitHub user [kofujimura](https://github.com/kofujimura). I debugged and added extra functionality to the code in the [original repository](https://github.com/kofujimura/gitVis3D), and added a Bitcoin option here for my architecture school application.**

GitVis3D is a visualization tool for git communities. This tool visualizes a versioning graph 
that consists of contribution edges and update edges as 3D animation in which new nodes and edges 
are added to the scene over time. 

The basic idea of the visualizing method of the versioning graph in 3D space is shown as follows:

This tool also contains a funciton that automatically creates a versioning graph from commit logs 
retrieved from the GitHub repository via [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/). 
To reduce the number of requests sent to the GitHub API, the created versioning graph is stored in 
the [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/download/other-releases/#releases) graph database.
